# Inventory Application API

Developed during my Co-op at Aztec Technologies for the use of recording stock and inventory

## Overview

This is the API, or model and controller of the overall application. The frontend or view is on another repository. This application is made with the Flask library, which runs a WSGI app, and was deployed using waitress. It consists of both the HTTP exposed API and a SQL Server interface that handle the database interactions.
